        v/s when we commit the transaction (end of the atomic code block).
        - Don't use row locking.

    the frequency of requests to this endpoint (or any endpoint modifying the
    account balance) is greater than the time it takes for the atomic code
    block to run, then we can expect race conditions to occur.

    Typically, these kinds of things won't be found in development (unless you
    have really experienced dev teams with good code review skills).

    business logic. The random_delay represents processing the data related
    to the account and the request. During this time, we really don't want
    anything else to be using the account data (due to the risk of reading
    stale data).

    Due to the absence of a large delay, the window for the race condition to

    Race conditions are now unlikely to occur but still very much possible.

    If you're only using 1 sync gunicorn worker then race conditions are not
